                experience that offers an easy glacier
                hike on Sólheimajökull glacier with
                an experienced glacier guide and is
                available all year around. The tour
                offers a pick-up from Reykjavík or a
                meet on location at Sólheimajökull
                glacier. Add even more adventure to
                your stay in Iceland and come

<p>
    Ice climbing is the activity of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls,
     frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water.</p>
     
<p>
For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice. Alpine ice is found in a 
mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed in an attempt to summit a mountain. Water ice 
is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a
 frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in 
 common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, 
 independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. Ice can be soft, hard, brittle or tough.
